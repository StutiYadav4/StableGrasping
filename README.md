# StableGrasping
This repository has the codes of machine learning for the representation of a robot's stable grasp. 

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict the stability of a grasping robotic arm using sensor data from its joints. It explores the use of machine learning to predict the robustness of a shadow robot arm. Robustness refers to the robot's ability to maintain performance and stability under varying conditions.
